# ColBERT Training
PyLate training is based on Sentence Transformer (and thus transformers) trainer, enabling a lot of functionality such multi-GPU and FP16/BF16 training as well as logging to Weights & Biases out-of-the-box. This allows efficient, and scalable training.

???+ info
    There are two primary ways to train ColBERT models using PyLate:

    1. **Contrastive Loss**: Simplest method, it only requires a dataset containing triplets, each consisting of a query, a positive document (relevant to the query), and a negative document (irrelevant to the query). This method trains the model to maximize the similarity between the query and the positive document, while minimizing it with the negative document.

    2. **Knowledge Distillation**: To train a ColBERT model using knowledge distillation, you need to provide a dataset with three components: queries, documents, and the relevance scores between them. This method compresses the knowledge of a larger model / more accurate model (cross-encoder) into a smaller one, using the relevance scores to guide the training process.

## Contrastive Training

ColBERT was originally trained using contrastive learning. This approach involves teaching the model to distinguish between relevant (positive) and irrelevant (negative) documents for a given query. The model is trained to maximize the similarity between a query and its corresponding positive document while minimizing the similarity with irrelevant documents.

PyLate uses contrastive learning with a triplet dataset, where each query is paired with one positive and one negative example. **This makes it fully compatible with any triplet datasets from the sentence-transformers library**.

During training, the model is optimized to maximize the similarity between the query and its positive example while minimizing the similarity with all negative examples and the positives from other queries in the batch. This approach leverages in-batch negatives for more effective learning.

Here is an example of code to run contrastive training with PyLate:

```python
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from sentence_transformers import (
    SentenceTransformerTrainer,
    SentenceTransformerTrainingArguments,
)

from pylate import evaluation, losses, models, utils

# Define model parameters for contrastive training
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"  # Choose the pre-trained model you want to use as base
batch_size = 32  # Larger batch size often improves results, but requires more memory

num_train_epochs = 1  # Adjust based on your requirements
# Set the run name for logging and output directory
run_name = "contrastive-bert-base-uncased"
output_dir = f"output/{run_name}"

# 1. Here we define our ColBERT model. If not a ColBERT model, will add a linear layer to the base encoder.
model = models.ColBERT(model_name_or_path=model_name)

# Compiling the model makes the training faster
model = torch.compile(model)

# Load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("sentence-transformers/msmarco-bm25", "triplet", split="train")
# Split the dataset (this dataset does not have a validation set, so we split the training set)
splits = dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.01)
train_dataset = splits["train"]
eval_dataset = splits["test"]

# Define the loss function
train_loss = losses.Contrastive(model=model)

# Initialize the evaluator
dev_evaluator = evaluation.ColBERTTripletEvaluator(
    anchors=eval_dataset["query"],
    positives=eval_dataset["positive"],
    negatives=eval_dataset["negative"],
)

# Configure the training arguments (e.g., batch size, evaluation strategy, logging steps)
args = SentenceTransformerTrainingArguments(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    num_train_epochs=num_train_epochs,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,
    fp16=True,  # Set to False if you get an error that your GPU can't run on FP16
    bf16=False,  # Set to True if you have a GPU that supports BF16
    run_name=run_name,  # Will be used in W&B if `wandb` is installed
    learning_rate=3e-6,
)

# Initialize the trainer for the contrastive training
trainer = SentenceTransformerTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
    loss=train_loss,
    evaluator=dev_evaluator,
    data_collator=utils.ColBERTCollator(model.tokenize),
)
# Start the training process
trainer.train()

```
???+ tip
    Please note that temperature parameter has a [very high importance in contrastive learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Wang_Understanding_the_Behaviour_of_Contrastive_Loss_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf). A low temperature allows to focus more on the hardest elements in the batch, creating more discriminative representations but is more sensible to false negative. A temperature around 0.02 is often used in the literature:
    ```python
    train_loss = losses.Contrastive(model=model, temperature=0.02)
    ```

???+ tip
    As contrastive learning is not compatible with gradient accumulation, you can leverage [GradCache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06983) to emulate bigger batch sizes without requiring more memory by using the `CachedContrastiveLoss` to define a mini_batch_size while increasing the `per_device_train_batch_size`:
    ```python
    train_loss = losses.CachedContrastive(
            model=model, mini_batch_size=mini_batch_size
    )
    ```
???+ tip
    Finally, if you are in a multi-GPU setting, you can gather all the elements from the different GPUs to create even bigger batch sizes by setting `gather_across_devices` to `True` (for both `Contrastive` and `CachedContrastive` losses):
    ```python
    train_loss = losses.Contrastive(model=model, gather_across_devices=True)
    ```

???+ tip
    Please note that for multi-GPU training, running ``python training.py`` **will use Data Parallel (DP) by default**. We strongly suggest using using Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP) using accelerate or torchrun: ``accelerate launch --num_processes num_gpu training.py``.

## Knowledge Distillation Training

Training late-interaction models, such as ColBERT, has been shown to benefit from knowledge distillation compared to simpler contrastive learning approaches. Knowledge distillation training focuses on teaching ColBERT models to replicate the outputs of a more capable teacher model (e.g., a cross-encoder). This is achieved using a dataset that includes queries, documents, and the scores assigned by the teacher model to each query/document pair.

Below is an example of code to run knowledge distillation training using PyLate:

```python
import torch
from datasets import load_dataset
from sentence_transformers import (
    SentenceTransformerTrainer,
    SentenceTransformerTrainingArguments,
)

from pylate import losses, models, utils

# Load the datasets required for knowledge distillation (train, queries, documents)
train = load_dataset(
    path="lightonai/ms-marco-en-bge",
    name="train",
)

queries = load_dataset(
    path="lightonai/ms-marco-en-bge",
    name="queries",
)

documents = load_dataset(
    path="lightonai/ms-marco-en-bge",
    name="documents",
)

# Set the transformation to load the documents/queries texts using the corresponding ids on the fly
train.set_transform(
    utils.KDProcessing(queries=queries, documents=documents).transform,
)

# Define the base model, training parameters, and output directory
model_name = "bert-base-uncased"  # Choose the pre-trained model you want to use as base
batch_size = 16
num_train_epochs = 1
# Set the run name for logging and output directory
run_name = "knowledge-distillation-bert-base"
output_dir = f"output/{run_name}"

# Initialize the ColBERT model from the base model
model = models.ColBERT(model_name_or_path=model_name)

# Compiling the model to make the training faster
model = torch.compile(model)

# Configure the training arguments (e.g., epochs, batch size, learning rate)
args = SentenceTransformerTrainingArguments(
    output_dir=output_dir,
    num_train_epochs=num_train_epochs,
    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,
    fp16=True,  # Set to False if you get an error that your GPU can't run on FP16
    bf16=False,  # Set to True if you have a GPU that supports BF16
    run_name=run_name,
    learning_rate=1e-5,
)

# Use the Distillation loss function for training
train_loss = losses.Distillation(model=model)

# Initialize the trainer
trainer = SentenceTransformerTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=args,
    train_dataset=train,
    loss=train_loss,
    data_collator=utils.ColBERTCollator(tokenize_fn=model.tokenize),
)

# Start the training process
trainer.train()

```

### NanoBEIR evaluator

If you are training an English retrieval model, PyLate now features [NanoBEIREvaluator](https://x.com/tomaarsen/status/1857434642569138243), an evaluator that allows to run small versions of the BEIR datasets to get an idea of the performance on BEIR without taking too long to run.
```python
evaluator=evaluation.NanoBEIREvaluator(),
```
You can select a subset of all the sets to run by adding the dataset names: `evaluation.NanoBEIREvaluator(dataset_names=["SciFact"])`

## ColBERT parameters
All the parameters of the ColBERT modeling can be found [here](https://lightonai.github.io/pylate/api/models/ColBERT/#parameters). Important parameters to consider are:

???+ info
    - `model_name_or_path` the name of the base encoder model or PyLate model to init from.
    - `embedding_size` the output size of the projection layer. Large values give more capacity to the model but are heavier to store.
    - `query_prefix` and `document_prefix` represents the strings that will be prepended to query and document respectively.
    - `query_length` and `document_length` set the maximum size of queries and documents. Queries will be padded/truncated to the maximum length while documents are only truncated.
    - `attend_to_expansion_tokens` define whether the model will attend to the query expansion tokens (padding of queries) or if only the expansion tokens will attend to the other tokens. In the original ColBERT, the tokens **do not attend** to expansion tokens.
    - `skiplist_words` is list of words to skip from the documents scoring (note that these tokens are used for encoding and are only skipped during the scoring), the default is the list of string.punctuation as in the original ColBERT.


## Sentence Transformers Training Arguments

PyLate is built on top of SentenceTransformer, so you can use the same arguments you are already familiar with to control the training process. The table below lists the arguments available in the SentenceTransformerTrainingArguments class.

Refer to `Training Overview > Dataset Format`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | loss        | `torch.nn.Module`, `Dict[str, torch.nn.Module]`, Callable, or Dict[str, Callable], *optional*     | The loss function to use for training. It can be a loss class instance, a dictionary mapping dataset names to loss instances, a function returning a loss instance given a model, or a dictionary mapping dataset names to such functions. Defaults to `CoSENTLoss` if not provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
    | evaluator   | `~sentence_transformers.evaluation.SentenceEvaluator` or `List[~sentence_transformers.evaluation.SentenceEvaluator]`, *optional* | The evaluator instance for useful metrics during training. Can be used with or without an `eval_dataset`. A list of evaluators will be wrapped in a `SequentialEvaluator` to run sequentially. Generally, evaluator metrics are more useful than loss values from `eval_dataset`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
    | callbacks   | `List[transformers.TrainerCallback]`, *optional*                                                  | A list of callbacks to customize the training loop. Adds to the list of default callbacks. To remove a default callback, use the `Trainer.remove_callback` method.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    | optimizers  | `Tuple[torch.optim.Optimizer, torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR]`, *optional*, defaults to `(None, None)` | A tuple containing the optimizer and scheduler to use. Defaults to an instance of `torch.optim.AdamW` for the model and a scheduler given by `transformers.get_linear_schedule_with_warmup`, controlled by `args`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
