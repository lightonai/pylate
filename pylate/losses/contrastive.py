    Contrastive loss. Expects as input two texts and a label of either 0 or 1. If the label == 1, then the distance between the
    two embeddings is reduced. If the label == 0, then the distance between the embeddings is increased.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        ColBERT model.
    score_metric
        ColBERT scoring function. Defaults to colbert_scores.
    size_average
        Average by the size of the mini-batch.
    gather_across_devices
        Whether to gather the embeddings across devices to have more in batch negatives. We recommand making sure the sampling across GPUs use the same dataset in case of multi-dataset training to make sure the negatives are plausible.

    Examples
    --------
