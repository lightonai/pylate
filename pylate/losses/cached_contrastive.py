    Parameters
    ----------
    model :
        A PyLate ColBERT model
    score_metric
        ColBERT scoring function. Defaults to colbert_scores.
    mini_batch_size
        Chunk size for the forward pass. You can keep this small to avoid OOM on large batch sizes.
    size_average
        Whether to average or sum the cross-entropy loss across the mini-batch.
    gather_across_devices
        Whether to gather the embeddings across devices to have more in batch negatives. We recommand making sure the sampling across GPUs use the same dataset in case of multi-dataset training to make sure the negatives are plausible.
    show_progress_bar
        Whether to show a TQDM progress bar for the embedding steps.

    Examples
    --------
